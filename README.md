# 🎨 Hirst Painting Generator (Python Turtle Project)

A fun and visually stunning project inspired by Damien Hirst's dot paintings. Built using Python's `turtle` graphics and `colorgram`, this script generates a grid of randomly colored dots extracted from an image, recreating the artistic style programmatically.

---

## 📌 Features

- Extracts a color palette from any image using `colorgram`
- Randomizes colors to recreate Hirst-style abstract dot patterns
- Draws a 10x10 dot grid using `turtle` with color variation
- Uses RGB values and precise turtle movement to keep everything aligned and aesthetic

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use the `turtle` module for GUI drawing
- Extracting dominant colors from an image using `colorgram`
- Working with RGB color modes and randomization in design
- Looping and grid logic to control drawing dynamically
- Simulating real art styles programmatically

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install colorgram.py
2. Make sure you have an image named image.jpg in your working directory (used for color extraction).
3. python main.py
4. 💡 You can replace image.jpg with any other image file to generate a different palette!
